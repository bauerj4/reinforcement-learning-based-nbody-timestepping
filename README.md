# N-Body Timestepping with Reinforcement Learning

Experimentation with techniques to apply reinforcement learning to N-Body adaptive timestepping.

## Timestepping Module

This module contains the methods to run a brute force N-Body simualtion, apply reinforcement learning techniques, and produce a policy that can be used in other simulation codes. This is intended as a research project focused on the timestepping component of the simulation. Please adapt as needed to your production simulation code (i.e. GADGET-4).
